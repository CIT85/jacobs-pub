            <h3>There are many ways to inline skate</h3>
                <p>Perhaps more accurately there are multiple disciplines to inline skating</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Urban Skating
                            <p>The setup for urban skating is usuall the typical 4 wheel skates though 3 wheels can be common as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Aggressive Skating
                            <p>Involes skating with smaller wheels and what is known as an anti-rocker setup and a H-block for primarily performing grinds.</p>
                            <img src="../img/Aggressive_Skate_Example.png" alt="Example of an aggressive skate" title="Notice the smaller inside wheels forming the anti-rocker setup" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">

                        <li>
                            Speed Skating
                            <p>Usually the skates for this style of skating will have very large 3 wheeled setups allowing for improved speed at the cost of stability.</p>
                            <img src="../img/speed_skate.png" alt="Example of a speed skate" title="Notice the decrease in ankle support these are not for the inexperienced" width="318" height="250" loading="lazy">

                            Wizard Skating
                            <p>My personal favorite form of skating though I am too inexperienced to even attempt this yet.</p>
                            <p>Wizard skating involves performing many different tricks without ever leaving the ground usually. This requires a great deal of experience but the results are truely amazing.</p>
                            <p>Wizard skating setups commonly have a rocked setup where the front and rear wheels are raised slightly and 5 or more wheels are common for greatly increased stability.</p>
