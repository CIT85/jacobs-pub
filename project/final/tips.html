            <h2>Choosing Filament</h2>
                <p>
                    For home use most people would be ok with PLA for objects that don't see stresses or high temperatures. PETG and ABS are good step up filaments for those who want more durability and temperature resistence. PETG will be easier to print with while ABS has the better thermal tollerances but requires an enclosed printer and has a tendency to expel alot of VOCs.

            <h2>Optimising Print Settings</h2>
                <p>
                    Basic print setting optimization includes speed and temp settings. This is usually done with what is called a temp tower but I have found that does not represent real world printing conditions enough unless you print only small objects. A better practice would be to change settings from print to print and as you print you will get the hang of what needs to change. Example if your prints overhangs look a little ozzy you can try lower temps increasing cooling or lowering print speed. usually the cause for overhang issues is either too high a print temp or unsupported steep overhangs. For further setting optimization visit <a href="advanced.html">this</a> page.

                <p>
                    Post-processing techniques are essential for refining the appearance, strength, and functionality of 3D printed parts.

                    <h3>Sanding</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sanding is a widely used post-processing technique in 3D printing to refine the surface finish and eliminate visible layer lines from printed parts. It involves using abrasive materials, such as sandpaper or sanding sponges, to gently remove imperfections and rough areas from the surface of the printed object. By sanding the part in a systematic manner, gradually progressing from coarse to fine grits, layer lines can be smoothed out, resulting in a more uniform and aesthetically pleasing finish. Sanding is particularly effective for parts printed with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, where layer lines are more pronounced. Additionally, sanding can be combined with other post-processing techniques, such as priming and painting, to further enhance the appearance and surface quality of the printed part. Overall, sanding is a straightforward and cost-effective method to improve the visual appeal and tactile properties of 3D printed objects, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from prototyping to functional end-use parts.

                    <h3>Vapor Polishing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Vapor polishing is a post-processing technique used to smooth the surface of 3D printed parts, particularly those made from thermoplastic materials like ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). This method involves exposing the printed part to vaporized solvent, typically acetone, in a controlled environment. The acetone vapor interacts with the surface of the ABS plastic, causing it to slightly dissolve and re-solidify, resulting in a smoother finish.
