                    <h4>Closed-Loop Systems</h4>
                        <p>
                            Closed-loop systems in 3D printing refer to recycling and waste management processes designed to minimize material waste and resource consumption. These systems aim to create a sustainable manufacturing cycle by collecting and reusing leftover materials, failed prints, and support structures. In a closed-loop system, excess material is recycled and reintroduced into the printing process, reducing material costs, environmental impact, and reliance on virgin materials. Closed-loop systems promote circular economy principles, where resources are used efficiently, waste is minimized, and environmental sustainability is prioritized.
