# description of my topic
3d printing is another word for additive manufacturing and is something I really enjoy playing around with. It gives me the ability to make all sorts of thing straight from home. Extreamly useful for things you can't buy and sometimes I can actually print something faster then it would take to get the item some other way.

## Why I am selecting 3d prinintg as my project topic
I have two 3d printers and have learned alot about 3d printing and though it would be cool to make my project on here about that.
I think it will be interesting to see what chatgpt some up with what I may have to correct and what I may learn as well.

## Prompts
Prompt 1 is: I need an outline for general 3d-printing information with 5 topics and at least 1-2 subtopics for all those 5 topics
This should get me going real quick
From here the rest of the promts will be asking for furter information on all the topics given to me from the above prompt.

Prompt 2 is: Outline for 3d printing tips with 3 points and a sub-point for one of those points
Just wanted to see what i got and i think i can work with it

As I work more on this project my promts are getting better for generating the content I want
example prompt "small overview of faster printing speeds and increased material options": has given me everything I need for my advancements in technology section perfectly.

#### How grid is used for my page layout
Essentially the grid is used just to move the main content and leave empty grid space for the unmoving header and nav/sidebar section
These header and nav sections use fixed position to hold their place on the page. At first I was trying to use fixed postion while they were grid elements but that doesn't work which makes me wonder how in the world my sticky elements work at all being in a grid themselves but hey I'll take it.

#### Breakpoints
I'll be using the tailwind breakpoints.
