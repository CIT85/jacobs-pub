            <h2>First Steps to as Perfect a Printer You Can Get</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>Extruder Calibration</h3>
                        <p>This step must be done first no matter what all callibration depends on this being tuned correctly.</p>
                    <h3>First Layer Squish</h3>
                        <p>Easily the second most important thing or just as important as having a clean build surface. From the image below the middle square is closest to what you want.</p>

                    <h3>Pressure Advance / Linear Advance</h3>
                        <p>Really good to tune. Esspecially with bowden setups.</p>
                    <h3>Extrusion Multiplier</h3>
                        <p>Can be usefull if using different filaments but for the most part a bandaid for a poorly tuned extruder.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Tuning</h2>
                <h3>Input Shaping</h3>
                    <p>
                        Actually not in the above mentioned guide I guess maybe I am just blind. But this is very critical for faster printers. It essentially cancles out all vibrational artifacts imposed in the print caused by faster print speeds. Word of caution here though your printers needs to be as solid as possible otherwise input shaping could just end up smoothing out all the details in the print.
