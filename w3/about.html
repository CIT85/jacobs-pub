        <h2>Why I Am Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>I thought learning HMTL and CSS would be a cool thing to do in my educational journey. Sure it doesn't relate to my major but this is fun and what is the pont in education if you don't learn something cool and interesting.</p>

        <h2>Using ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>Using chatGPT is very cool and quick. I really struggle with getting started on any project and chatGPT has made that a complete non-issue. Just tell it what you need and bam you got it.</p>
